FinchController
===============

This project is for the FINCH ROBOT. It contains the necessary files to use the Finch Robot as a controller via keyboard. Specifically, the FinchController allows the Finch Robot to maneuver using the Arrow Keys, a slider to set the speed, and a color picker to choose and set colors (set colors either fixed or for each KeyEvent).
